EspressoGameBox is a hobby project that turns an **ESP32‚ÄëWROOM‚Äë32E**, an **ILI9341 TFT display**, tactile switches and an SD¬†card into a tiny ‚Äúdownload‚Äësoftware‚Äù style game machine‚Äîthink *Nintendo¬†3DS* e‚Äëshop titles, but DIY.  It stores a lightweight menu/OS in flash while individual game binaries live on the SD¬†card, so you can swap, add or remove titles without reflashing firmware.

English is not my first language and I'm still learning, so some sentences may sound a bit unusual‚Äîplease bear with me! Development progresses whenever time allows, and feedback or pull requests are always welcome!

## Features

* **Menu OS stored in flash** ‚Äì choose games with a simple GUI rendered at 60¬†fps.
* **SD‚Äëcard game library** ‚Äì drop compiled game files (`*.bin`) into `/games/` and they appear automatically.
* **Tactile‚Äëswitch controls** ‚Äì D‚Äëpad¬†+¬†buttons mapped via GPIO; debounce handled in software.
* **PCM sound playback** ‚Äì tiny speaker driven by the built‚Äëin DAC (planned).
* **Pluggable game API** ‚Äì lightweight C/C++ interface so new games can target the box with minimal boilerplate (WIP).

Overall¬†status: **alpha** ‚Äì usable for experimentation, not feature‚Äëcomplete.

## Getting Started

> ‚ö†Ô∏è *Build & flash procedure is under construction; steps may change.*

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-github>/EspressoGameBox.git
$ cd EspressoGameBox

# 2. Install ESP‚ÄëIDF¬†(v5.x) and add to PATH
$ . "$HOME/esp/esp-idf/export.sh"

# 3. Configure (select serial port, etc.)
$ idf.py menuconfig

# 4. Build & flash
$ idf.py flash monitor
```

Insert an SD¬†card containing a `/games/` folder with compiled `*.bin` titles; the menu will discover and launch them.

### Dependencies

* **ESP‚ÄëIDF¬†5.x** (Arduino‚ÄëESP32 core ‚â•‚ÄØ3.0 will be supported later)
* Python¬†3.10+, CMake, Ninja
